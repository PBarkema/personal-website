    description: Investigated Human Brain and Perception using brain scanners (7T fMRI, MEG) and computational modelling (e.g. Deep Learning, Bayesian Learning). I investigated representations in the human brain and developed a theory for how the human brain creates illusions. Seperately, I modelled how the hippocampus in the human brain learn statistical patterns in the environment and calculates uncertainty.
