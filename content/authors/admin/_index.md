I am a **Brain & AI Scientist** at **University College London**, and a **Scientific Programmer** at Donders Institute. I am interested in how the Human Brain creates **Hallucinations** and learns **Uncertainty**, both huge problems in AI Safety. I want to leverage my unique perspective to help overcome these challenges. I currently lead two multi-year experimental brain scanning studies (7T fMRI and MEG) and one computational modelling study (**Deep Neural Networks**, **Bayesian Modelling**) to investigate how human neural networks create false beliefs (hallucination) and calculate uncertainty about its own internal states (introspection) - leading to multiple peer-reviewed articles and high-profile talks. I have professional experience evaluating and training LLMs at **Google Assistant**, and developed [PCNportal](https://pcnportal.dccn.nl/), a collaborative **open-source Machine Learning app** for big data brain analysis.

Humans and LLMs are both interrogable black boxes. I want to use my scientific expertise to make LLMs become more accurate in their thinking, through experimental design and computational modelling of their internal representations.
