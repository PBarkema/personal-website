### The Science of Postdiction
Do brain representations reflect what was presented to our eyes (retinal input) or what we actually perceive? This project investigates **Postdiction**, a phenomenon where information arriving later influences how we perceive an earlier event.

### Research Highlights & Technical Achievements
* **Advanced Neuroimaging:** Used **7T fMRI** to achieve layer-specific resolution in the primary visual cortex (V1).
* **Layer-Specific Decoding:** Discovered that **deep layers of V1** encode subjective perception (illusory flashes), while **middle layers** continue to track the objective retinal input.
* **Top-Down Modulation:** Identified that postdictive perception is likely facilitated by feedback from **superior temporal cortex** to the early visual cortex.
* **Project Management:** Led a **£400K project** end-to-end, managing a team of three students and coordinating data collection for over 300 participants.
* **High-Impact Communication:** Presented findings at the **Visual Science Society (VSS) 2025**.

### Scientific Impact
Our findings complete a **feedback model** of sensory processing across seeing and hearing, suggesting that early visual cortex is not just a passive relay station but an active participant in constructing hallucinations and perception.
